# Part-1 
This part of the project contains of problems that are mentioned in the book.

## First Question:
Using the ATmega328P pin configuration table and the Arduino Duemilanove Schematic in [list](https://url.here), state all of the pins on the three ports that are already dedicated to an alternative function via pin-muxing.  
*Hint: all the pins in the table correspond to pins on the schematic; some ofthem will go to specific circuitry other than the headers.*
